#Card Puzzle

As a part of the interview process for Audible, Inc., an Amazon.com, Inc. subsidiary, I was given the following Code Puzzle to solve in few hours -

##### Code up a simple class in the language of your choice (Objective-C is preferred) to represent a standard deck of playing cards with an   operation to shuffle the deck and an operation to deal one card. Imagine that this code will be used by your coworkers, and should conform to their high standards. You may write additional classes if that would help, and you are free to use any of the standard language APIs. For reference, a standard deck of cards has 52 cards and four suits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck
